        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a professional software engineer with a bachelor's degree in
            computer engineering and experience in C++, Java, Python, and C#.
            Born and raised in Springdale, Arkansas, my passion for computers
            started early when I got my first computer at four years old. Later
            on I developed a passion for software engineering when I was in high
            school and discovered the work of the Google Deepmind team. Seeing an
            AI learn chess from scratch in just four hours and defeat a chess engine
            developed by humans for decades was mind blowing.
